    <hr class="m-y-2">
    <p>Lintable is a code analysis tool that integrates with GitHub to automatically perform static analysis on pending pull requests. Lintable only checks the code that will be modified by each pull request, so its results are focused and manageable. Lintable currently includes support for detecting trailing whitespace. Bigger, better, faster features are in the works though, so check back regularly to see the latest from Lintable.</p>
